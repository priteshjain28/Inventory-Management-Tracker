# Inventory-Management-Tracker
Welcome to the Inventory-Management-Tracker repository, where you will find an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows for real-time tracking, analysis, and optimization of inventory management.

This dashboard was designed to help businesses improve their operations by making data-driven decisions. It provides a comprehensive overview of inventory status for multiple SKUs and includes multiple visualizations and charts such as bar charts and pie charts that show inventory levels, reorder points, and lead times for each SKU. Additionally, it includes the ability to filter and drill down by category, supplier, and location, making it easy for users to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in their inventory management.

The dashboard is built on a foundation of thorough data preparation and cleaning using Python, and extensive data wrangling. It showcases my expertise in data analytics and inventory management, and how to effectively use data to drive business decisions.

I hope you find this dashboard to be a valuable tool in your inventory management efforts. If you have any questions or want to learn more about my work in data analytics and inventory management, please don't hesitate to reach out.
